                        <h3>Acquisition and Types of Plugins</h3>
                        <p>The plugins developed by "Undermax / Maxii1996" available on this platform are classified into two categories:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>DEMO Plugins:</strong> These plugins are available for use or download without any payment. Users must credit "Undermax", "Undermax Games", or "Maxii1996" (at their discretion) in the credits of the project where the plugin is used.</li>
                            <li><strong>FULL Plugins:</strong> These plugins require payment for use or download. Attribution is optional but can be given to "Undermax", "Undermax Games", or "Maxii1996" in the project's acknowledgements for the creation of the plugin.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Reuse and Distribution of Plugins</h3>
                        <p>It is strictly prohibited to share FULL plugins with other users, or to publish them on the internet or other platforms. Reselling the plugins in any form is also forbidden. Modifications to plugins are allowed as long as the original author is credited, and the main functionality of the plugin is not altered. An individual who acquires a FULL plugin may reuse it in any of their personal projects. In group projects, all associated users must be credited.</p>

                        <h3>Authorized Distribution Platform</h3>
                        <p>All plugins will be hosted and managed through the Itch.io platform at <a href="https://undermax.itch.io/" target="_blank">https://undermax.itch.io/</a>. This is the only authorized method for downloading and distributing the plugins. Users are responsible for managing their accounts and the content they acquire, including their access credentials. Undermax | Maxii1996 is not liable for any misuse of the platform or account access.</p>

                        <h3>Plugin Support and Compatibility</h3>
                        <p>All plugins are developed under the "Vanilla" category, meaning compatibility with other plugins, especially those from different authors, cannot be guaranteed. While Undermax / Maxii1996 strives to maintain compatibility as much as possible, there may be situations where a plugin is incompatible with another. Users are encouraged to post detailed comments explaining any issues they encounter. Responses will be provided to clarify whether an adaptation of the plugin is possible. Updates will be made if necessary. Proper operation is only guaranteed with RPG MAKER MZ in its factory state, without any other installed plugins that modify its functionality.</p>

                        <h3>Bundles and Promotions</h3>
                        <p>Promotions, discounts, and bundles are managed by Undermax / Maxii1996 through the Itch.io platform, using the tools, features, and functionalities provided by the platform.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Seasonal Bundles:</strong> These bundles replace the previous Monthly Bundles and are available for purchase during the specified season. They offer users the opportunity to access all plugins developed up to that point, as well as any new plugins released during the bundle's period. The price for the current season's bundle will remain fixed throughout its validity period. Users can download updated plugins from the bundle's purchase page if any updates occur during the bundle period.</li>
                            <li><strong>Numbered Bundles:</strong> These bundles contain five plugins at a special price, lower than the individual price of each plugin. They are released every time five plugins are published chronologically, meaning a new bundle becomes available over time as the set of five plugins is completed.</li>
                        </ul>
